# Project.identify_customer_segments
This was my final project in the "Introduction to Machine Learning with PyTorch" nano degree program at Udacity

# Identify Customer Segments
Project code for Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning with PyTorch" Nanodegree program.

## Information to the project ##
The task was to analyse general data and customer specific data from ARVATO to finde the best fitting customer clusters for a campaign.

## Explanation ##
There are the following files to use:
<ul>
  <li>Identify Customer Segments.ipynb: This is the Jupyter Notebook i developed the code. For submission a html-file is included. </li>
</ul>
The data needed for the Wrangling part was given by Udacity during the program. I had to delete it after finishing the porject.
